# Quick Start

<OSTabSelect />

## Install

```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.instancez.ai | sh
  ```
  Installs `inz` to `~/.local/bin`. Check it works: `inz version`.
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.instancez.ai | sh
  ```
  Works on x86-64 and ARM64. Installs `inz` to `~/.local/bin`. Check it works: `inz version`.
  ```powershell
  irm https://get.instancez.ai/windows | iex
  ```
  Installs `inz.exe` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\instancez\bin`. Run in PowerShell 5.1+. Check it works: `inz version`.
  Need a manual download or more options? See the [Installation guide](/instancez/install/).

## Create a project

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
inz init
```

This creates `instancez.yaml` (project name inferred from the directory) with a `todos` table, an `avatars` storage bucket, and a `todos` code function. Nothing touches the database yet.

Code functions run in Node.js workers, so the example function is only scaffolded when Node.js 22+ is on your PATH. Without it, `inz init` prints a warning and skips the function; everything else works the same.

## Start the dev server

The quickest way to start is the Postgres that ships inside `inz`. You do not need to install or run a database yourself:

```bash
inz dev --embedded-pg
```

The first run downloads a Postgres 16 binary (about 30 MB) and keeps its data in `./pgdata/`. Later runs reuse that directory. To start over from an empty database, add `--reset-pg`.

**Or point at your own Postgres.** If you already have a Postgres 14+ instance, drop the flag and set a superuser connection string:

```bash
export INSTANCEZ_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
inz dev
```

Either way, on first boot instancez provisions the Postgres roles it needs and writes a generated publishable key and secret key to `.development.env`. Both are printed in the `inz dev` startup output. Your API is live at `http://localhost:8080`, and saving `instancez.yaml` re-applies the schema automatically.

## Get your publishable key

Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:8080/dashboard`. The API Keys section shows your publishable key — copy it from there. (It's also in the `inz dev` startup output and `.development.env`.)

## Query your data

instancez speaks the same HTTP API as Supabase, so any Supabase client library works. Examples here use `@supabase/supabase-js`:

Your project starts with a `todos` table. Paste the publishable key you copied above:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient('http://localhost:8080', '<your-publishable-key>')

const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('todos')
  .select('*')
```

> The scaffolded `todos` table has a `user_id = auth.uid()` RLS policy, so rows are filtered by the
> authenticated user. To read without signing in, add a separate `- operations: [select]` policy with
> `using: "true"` in `instancez.yaml`. Don't loosen the existing policy: it also covers insert, update,
> and delete, so `using: "true"` there would open writes to anyone.

## Building with a coding agent

The repo ships an agent skill that teaches coding agents the YAML syntax, RLS patterns, and the `inz` CLI:

```bash
npx skills add instancez/instancez
```

See [Coding Agents](/instancez/coding-agents/) for Claude Code plugin install, per-agent flags, and the manual route.

## What's next

- [Tables / Schema](/instancez/build/schema/) — add tables, columns, and enums
- [Auth](/instancez/build/auth/) — sign up, sign in, OAuth, MFA
- [Querying](/instancez/build/querying/) — filters, embeds, pagination, aggregates
- [Deploy](/instancez/deploy/docker/) — run in production

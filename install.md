# Installation

The `inz` CLI is a single binary — no runtime dependencies, no package manager required.

**Requires Postgres 14+:** instancez connects to a PostgreSQL server you provide. Version 14 or later is required. Older versions are untested and some migrations will fail on them. Any standard Postgres works, whether it's a local install or a managed service like Neon or RDS.

**Code functions require Node.js:** If you plan to use [code functions](/instancez/build/functions/) (`functions:` block in `instancez.yaml`), you'll need **Node.js 22+** and **npm** installed. instancez checks for `node` at startup and refuses to boot if it's missing while functions are declared. Everything else (auth, database, storage, RLS) works without them.

Install Node.js (which includes npm) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) or via your system package manager.

## One-line install

```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.instancez.ai | sh
  ```
  Installs `inz` to `~/.local/bin`. If that directory isn't in your `PATH`, the script will tell you.
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://get.instancez.ai | sh
  ```
  Installs `inz` to `~/.local/bin`. Works on x86-64 and ARM64.
  ```powershell
  irm https://get.instancez.ai/windows | iex
  ```
  Installs `inz.exe` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\instancez\bin`. Run in PowerShell 5.1+.

  Alternatively, [download the `.exe` directly](#manual-download) and place it anywhere on your `PATH`.
  Verify the install:

```bash
inz version
```
